Operators : Operators are used  to perform operations between multiple operands
There are several types of operators in JS such as
1. Arithematic Operators:
   These operators are used to perform Arithematic operations between numerical values
   eg: + ,- , * ,/, %(remainder), **(power)
   let a = 10, b = 20;
console.log(a + b); //30
console.log(a - b); //-10
console.log(a * b); //200
console.log(a / b); //0.5
console.log(a % b); //10
console.log(2 ** 3); //8

2. logical operators : These operators are used perform logical AND,OR, NOT with conditions
   logical AND (&&) : it will be true only if both the conditions are true
   logical OR (||): it will be false only if both conditions are false
   logical NOT (!) : it will be true if condition is false and will be false if condition is true
   /* logical operators */
console.log(a > 5 && b < 10); //F
console.log(a > 5 || b < 10); //T
console.log(!(a > 5)); //F

3. Relational Operators: Relational Operators are used to compare the values
    eg: > , < ,>= , <= ,==, ===, !=, !==
    These operators returns boolean values.

4. Assignment Operators : These operators are used to assign a value to operands
   eg: += , -= ,*= ,/= ,%= ,**=,=
   a+=2 ===> a=a+2;
/* assignment operator */
a = 3, b = 2;
a += 2;   // a= a+2;
console.log(a); //5
a -= 2;  // a=a-2;
console.log(a); //3
a *= 2;  // a=a*2
console.log(a); //6
a /= 2;  // a=a/2
console.log(a); //3
a %= 2; //a=a%2
console.log(a); //1
a = 3;
a **= 2; // a= a**2
console.log(a) //9

5. Ternary Operator: This operator is used to assign  a value based on a condition
     let variable_name = (condition)  ? value1  : value2 ;
     if condition is true , first value will be given to variable , else second value will be given to variable. 
   eg: a = 5, b=3;
     let c = (a>10) ? 20 : 30;

     can you print message "pass" or "fail" based on marks ?

6. unary operators: These operators uses single operand
   eg: 
   unary '+'   -- it is used to convert any datatype to numbers
      +'5'  -->5

   increment and decrement : we can increase the value or decrease the value by 1 using these operators.
   ++  is used for increment ( increase value by 1 )
   -- is used for decrement (decrease value by 1)
   ++a  -- pre increment  -- it will first increase the value and assigns it
   a++  -- post increment -- it will first assign the value and then increase it.
   same thing applies for decrement also


we have special operators like "typeof" which is used to find the type of a variable and nullish coelison operator(??)
  a= undefined, b =2;
  let c = a ?? b ;
  it checks only first value is undefined or not, if it is, it will take second value else first value
